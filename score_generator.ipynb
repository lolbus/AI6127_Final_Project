            "<S> <S> part three okay hi I am calling regarding (um) the trip that I've went with your agency not long ago (ppb) (um) to korea and I'm actually calling because (um) I have some unhappiness that I have regarding the trip (ppb) especially with the tour guide so I'd like to make some (ppb) feedback (um) hoping that your company or your agency can (ppb) do the changes necessary <S> <S> <S> okay <S> yup okay so my name is jane my handphone number is nine triple four eight triple four and (um) the trip to korea was just earlier last month I guess (um) around twelve to four twelve to fifteen october so I went there for around a four day three nights stay at korea and what made me really unhappy was (um) firstly some of the tour guides like (um) they were very bad at korean so which was kind of surprising to me since (ppb) you know as a tour guide you are supposed to be very experienced in speaking their language there but they have some issues with (um) the korean language and he couldn't communicate with the locals very effectively (ppb) so a lot of times they were just (um) shouting to get their points across with the koreans locals and (ppb) I think that kind of ruined the mood for the rest of us and the (ppb) (um) tour guide I mean the the people there because I mean we come here to enjoy to (uh) to enjoy our holiday then you're just shouting across it just ruins the mood for me [lah] (ppb) and then besides that also I noticed that (um) the bus drivers that (um) you all employed to drive us around they weren't very sure of the routes (ppb) because most of time like one destination to another it shouldn't take that long according to the itinerary (ppb) but your bus driver took like maybe one hour when the itinerary only said that it will took like thirty minutes so I guess that wasted a lot of time and then (ppb) I mean it's obviously not comfortable to sit on the bus for a long time also because you might need to use the toilet and stuff so I mean besides me and my family other people were also unhappy [lah] but then (um) the tour guide keep saying to us that [oh] it's going according to plan (um) nothing to worry the bus driver is okay (ppb) but then if you look at the itinerary that was given to us I mean it's obviously that it wasn't going smoothly [lah] so that's something that I'm unhappy about also and then (um) I think the places that your company have arranged to bring us to a journey okay (ppb) it's fine but (um) the issue I have is with the food okay so the restaurants that you brought us to (ppb) (um) it's quite similar so every throughout the four days three nights every single night we have we are just eating korean barbecue over and over again so that kind of made me wonder if you all have planned (ppb) the itinerary well enough because (ppb) if you have done so then we shouldn't be eating the same food over and over again yup so <S> I think for all our dinners we had korean barbecue for lunch (um) I think only once korean barbecue and then that's it [lah] but it's just mainly the dinners maybe because there's a lot of korean barbecue outlets near our (ppb) (um) hotel but (ppb) I mean it doesn't make sense to serve us korean (ppl) barbecue every night (ppb) yeah <S> yup so I guess all these made me really unhappy [lah] because (ppb) I could tell that your tour guides were inexperienced because (ppb) they couldn't even communicate basic korean (ppb) and then (um) sometimes when we also asked them you know when we go (ppb) to visit museums and historical places and we asked them some history (ppb) then they were also unable to answer our questions so in the end we just had to google online and we self answered our own question so if that's case then I don't see a point why I should you know hire a tour guide or book your agency if I can get all the questions and answers by myself yup <S> okay I think generally both tour guides were quite poor in korean but (ppb) (um) the one that was espe~ especially more rude was (ppb) (um) the younger one so there's two guide two tour guides one was older one and then another is a younger female (ppb) so I mean sometimes when we ask her questions (ppb) (um) she will come and (um) say things like why do you all need to know so much you just walk and see take pictures can already so she was obviously unhappy about it [lah] so I think that was kind of rude since we are the customers yup (um) I mean I'm I'm not calling to like ask you to fire the staff or like scold the staff I'm I don't need that but (ppb) (um) what I want is for you to train your staffs properly so (ppb) before they even take up any (um) work or take up any trip you know they should be (ppb) at least knowledgeable about the country or the language of the country that they are going to like I I don't need a excellent tour guide but (ppb) the point that they can't even speak basic korean is just unacceptable to me [lah] because that just means that you haven't done your work you like you haven't prepared anything before going to that trip <S> <S> <S> yup (mm) I think I I don't need (um) your company to be accountable because past is the past already [lah] so (ppb) (uh) I don't need like a refund or apology or anything I'm fine with it but (ppb) I'm just calling to just make sure that you know you improve because (ppb) (um) my family and I we have always been (um) whenever we go overseas we have always engaged with your company with your agency (ppb) and book your tour guide so I mean I want to continue this relationship [lah] because (ppb) we have been with your company for many years already but (ppb) this experience really (um) in a sense made me lost my trust in your company a lot because it's just really unacceptable [lah] and just made the entire trip the mood just very bad it was supposed to be a happy holiday but then (ppb) I was annoyed most of the time not just me but my family also so (um) yup I I I don't need you to give me apology or anything but just I hope you can improve and then in the future like I hope I won't see anything like this happen again because I definitely still want to you know (um) hire your agency for my future trips since we have been together for such a long time already <S> <S> (mmhmm) so you mean specific examples is it (mm) I couldn't remember like exact example is because it happened so many times [lah] like (ppb) wherever we go to a new place like for example if we want to buy tickets to enter the museum (ppb) then the tour guide would be ordering the tickets at the counter right but (ppb) you could tell that she's having trouble communicating with (ppb) the the person that's selling the tickets and both of them seemed like very annoyed and stuff like that so I guess that is one specific example that I could remember of and then ya just other occasions also [lah] you can just tell that (ppb) they both the tour guide and the person the korean the local there (ppb) they weren't communicating well because of language barrier <S> <S> yup yup <S> <S> <S> okay \n",

            "<S> yup part one hello (um) I'm calling regarding the reservation that I've made with your restaurant just about three days ago (ppb) (um) I actually wish to change some details of my reservation so I'm calling to ask if it will be possible to make the changes <S> okay yup so originally I only book (um) a table for four and of course a set meal for four to celebrate my father's birthday (ppb) but this time round we decided to have a more grand birthday party (ppb) so instead of just booking four seats I want to book your entire restaurant so I don't know if that is possible with you <S> okay (um) I'm guessing maybe around fifty guests including like all my extended family my relatives and my dad friends as well (um) I want to hold it probably around next month (ppb) around either on a weekend so maybe the fifth or the sixth december so about one month away from today and I think just yup I just need the entire restaurant and then (ppb) also enough food catering [lah] for all the guests around fifty guests (ppb) and then I also just want a birthday cake for my dad a large one preferably (ppb) maybe red or blue because that's my dad's favourite colour <S> from four to fifty four to fifty yup <S> (mm) I think maybe a cake that is not too sweet any flavour will be fine (ppb) but preferably something like a bigger cake so it looks more grand and more special for my dad's birthday party yup yea yup (mm) I think for the food wise (ppb) (um) just have a wide variety of food so like (um) noodles rice then many different kind of side dishes (ppb) because I'm going have quite (um) a lot of guests so (ppb) all their preferences are different (ppb) and preferably maybe some small food that's easy for children to eat also because (ppb) we have some (um) young children that will be coming and then yup something sweet [lah] for those children also so that (um) it can entertain them and then (mm) in terms of decoration wise maybe just something more grand (um) I don't need it to be very aesthetic it's fine with me just balloons or like happy birthday banner would be fine yeah as long as it's clear that once you step in a restaurant [oh] we are having a party for my dad's birthday party that's sufficient yup <S> <S> <S> <S> (mm) okay (um) for children wise I think maybe we're expecting about five not a lot so just a small portion of food will be fine (ppb) but for the adult wise (um) I guess you can have some #halal# food that is separated from the non #halal# food cause we do have some muslim friends (ppb) and then for the non #halal# food preferably maybe just chinese food [lah] (ppb) those typical food that (um) our older parents our grandparents would like like maybe (um) porridge #dim sum# vegetables yup and also nothing too sweet [lah] because (ppb) my parents don't like sweet stuff so more on the healthier side yup (mm) okay (uh) maybe if possible you could play some music at the background just some comfortable one so that you know we can lighten up the mood yup <S> <S> <S> okay yup sure I'll bring it on the day itself yup and then (mm) maybe for the restaurant itself like could you put some cloths over the table <S> (um) maybe red so it looks more auspicious and more to my dad's liking yup <S> <S> <Z> yup so so all these changes will be possible right because (ppb) I only want to book the date from one month from now so there's more than enough time for the changes to be done <S> <S> <S> okay sure yup yup and (um) if you are not able to make the changes maybe could you inform me earlier so I can (ppb) cancel this reservation and go to another restaurant okay sure (mm) and (mm) would I don't know if it'll be possible but do you have some games or anything in the restaurant because I'm thinking that (um) for the young children who are coming they might get restless and bored easily because they don't talk as much as adults do (ppb) so if you have some games or some (ppb) (um) toys to entertain them in the restaurant that will be great <S> <S> okay sure <S> <S> (mm) I think definitely you should have some a mixture of both hot and cold drinks (ppb) and for your hot one maybe just tea or coffee yup for all the older age group who prefers hotter drinks (ppb) then for the cold drinks maybe something sweet for the children like (um) ribena or milk also milo and any soft drinks so just a wide variety [lah] to cater to different people cause we all have different preferences <S> (mm) okay I think alcoholic drink is fine but make sure you separate them because like I said we have some muslim friends so if you put all the drinks together I'm afraid they might be uncomfortable with that yup <S> okay (um) I think malays maybe around ten to fifteen yeah then the rest are all chinese so (um) don't have to make a lot of food for the muslims but just (uh) make sure they are #halal# [lah] cause I don't want my guests to come and then (ppb) they don't have anything to eat that's a bit rude

            "<S> part three okay [ah] hi is this (uh) asia travel agency <S> (mm) so I'm actually calling today because I had a very pleasant travel experience to japan and I would just like to comment you guys on the itinerary itinerary because I think it was very well planned and there was a good balance of relaxation and exploration so I think y~ you guys did a very good job on that <B> and yup (ppl) (mm) (mm) okay (uh) my name is (err) <P2>alice pooh</P2> and my contact number is nine one two three four five six seven (mm) <B>  yup (mm) [ah] (um) the tour package included a trip to #tokyo# and then to #osaka# after that and my tour guide was (um) <P2>lily tan</P2> (mm) yup [ah] I think she has like around shoulder length hair and she wear a black frames spectacles ya do you all have someone like that <Z> (uh) <P2>lily tan</P2> <Z> (mm) ya so I think (um) that particular tour guide did a very good job because during the especially during the free and easy time we will always ask her for recommendations on places that we can go to because we we did not do any prior research about japan so she will always tell us where to go to and her recommendations and it never fails our expectations <B> ya (mm) and I think she's very well versed with the japan attractions and places to go to and she's also very good at communicating with people because I think there was this one time where there was another (um) family who was also within the tour and they had an argument or disagreement with the (um) locals and she was the one who help them to solve the situation amicably ya so I think she's doing a very good job and I hope that you would help me to compliment that particular tour guide and maybe tell your boss about it (ppb) (mm) <S> (mm) ya <S> [oh] (um) did you all have a website where I can leave my feedback is it (um) [oh] is it [oh] it's just (uh) asia tours dot com or is there an another website (mm) <S> (mm) okay okay but I think that particular tour guide is very good in her job so maybe you all can use her as a benchmark for the other tour guides to ensure that the (um) service would be very would always be this good (ppl) (mm) ya and with regards to the (mm) [oh] ya <Z> <Z> (mm) ya I think the (mm) I think the itinerary was very well planned and yup there was enough time for us to sleep as well (ppl) because I think most tour feels very rushed but (um) this particular agency did a very good job at balancing the time very well and there was enough buffer time in case there's any delay with one of the (uh) attraction and there would still be time to go to all the other attractions that has been planned as well ya and I think there was this one time where (um) there was a bit too much time then our tour guide (um) thought of a place to go to and then she just brought us there so I think she did a very good job (ppl) with thinking on her feet yup and bringing us to places so that we can (um) explore the culture and be able to really experience this (uh) (uh) experience japan as a whole [lah] <B> (mm) <S> (mm) I think one of the best (ppo) (um) places that we went to was one of the restaurant that was just beside our hotel yup I think (mm) that one wasn't part of the itinerary (err) it was recommended by the tour guides so I thought it was very (um) the place look very quaint and (mm) and the chef was very friendly there as well and yup [ah] although we couldn't really read the menu but thanks to our tour guide she was able to translate everything for us and then even help us to order because we had a bit of a language barrier with the locals there ya <Z> <Z> (mm) and I think the hotel was very well picked out also because there was one of the hotel had the (um) the japanese mattress and it was very true to the culture then we also experienced another hotel which was very luxurious so I think we got to experience both parts of japan like both the luxurious side and how the locals live ya <S> <B> (mm) <S> (mmhmm) ya so I overall I'm very pleased with the agency service and how you all plan the itinerary and your (um) workers attitude so I would like to just (um) ask maybe for (um) future tour packages would it be similar or would you all change up the package <S> all the standard will be the same will the s~ (mm) <S> <S> <S> <S> <S> (mm) so (um) let's say if I sign up for the this rewards or membership program then I can is it do I accumulate points every time I spend money and then what can I do with the points after that <Z> <S> <S> <B> (mm) [oh] okay and (um) how do I sign up for this membership do I have to go to the website to sign up <B> or (mmhmm) [ah] okay (um) so if I want to sign up for my family members do they they just sign up (um) under my name or do does it have to be (um) one person only can have one membership account <B> or <S> <S> <Z> (mm) [ah] okay I see I see (err) maybe I I would need some time to consider about this membership thing (um) but is there anywhere where I can go to read up more about it <B> (mmhmm) (mm) okay and (mmhmm) <S> [oh] okay (err) so I can sign up for the newsletter and you guys would actually email us when you all have a promotion or s~ something

(uh) he was the guide that followed us from singapore #changi# airport (ppb) all the way there and I would just like to say that he did a good job (uh) doing his work [lah] so basically what happened was (uh) when we reached italy it was around (ppb) (uh) six P_M so it was (uh) really it was a really long flight for us it was about I think (uh) plus the transit it was about ten hours (ppb) and I just like to (uh) comment on john and he was a very good tour agent [eh] tour guide because like or even on the plane (ppb) like he talk to us so it was ve~ he was very friendly (ppb) so (uh) he introduced himself and like just talk to us (ppb) (uh) make sure that we are feeling okay about the whole flight and everything (ppb) so (uh) after we came down from our flight he also (uh) he also stood at the near the plane at the exit there and then like make sure everyone is there (ppb) so (uh) that was good and after that he (uh) cause it was already six plus when we reached the bus (uh) like after all the customs (ppb) and ya so he he actually plan it very well such that we could go back to our hotels to (uh) put down our all our heavy stuffs and get (uh) get all the winter jacket

have to carry a very heavy bag (ppb) so I felt like that was very good and after that (uh) he arranged such that we only have like one attraction to go so and like even though like the itinerary have like three places to go but he just plan just one (ppb) place for us to go such that like we don't have to be so tired [lah] so I felt like that was a good (ppb) (uh) a good job on him and after that he also didn't like just (uh) tell us [oh] because (uh) the timing because of the timing wise the two other places were cancelled (ppb) no he actually like he actually (uh) bring us to the place the morning after so I felt like that was that was good [lah] a~ assurance for us customers because I know other travel agents they always (ppb) they always like cut short the itinerary saying that there's no time and everything then (ppb) as customers we will feel a bit a bit like disappointed as well [lah] even though we know that it (uh) cannot be helped it but john actually (uh) managed to put everything into the itinerary despite of the timing issues (ppb) so that was a good job on him yes so (uh) I would like to comment on him because I felt that he's (ppb) also very experienced correct <S> ya so I felt that he was (ppb) he was very experienced and everything I asked him about (uh) italy he knows everything and like he knows what souvenirs to like (ppb) (uh) what we should what souvenirs we should buy (ppb) for our families and ya so that was a good job on him (ppb) so I feel like maybe you guys can (uh) you guys can just (ugh) maybe (uh) let him teach your juniors as well (ppb) because he's very experienced [lah] yup so ya I would like to (uh) comment on like how (ppb) the tour package w~ is very diverse as well so there was a di~ diversity of like (ppb) countryside cities and even like shopping for us because for us (uh) we have elderlys in our family and (ppb) they cannot shop much [lah] so lucky like the lucky the tour package sometimes even john allowed my grandparents to stay in the stay in the car (uh) car (uh) the tour bus when they were tired [lah] so I felt that was a good one so maybe you guys can have a option especially for elderlies [lah] they cannot walk much (ppb) so sometimes like very tiring (ugh) attractions they (ppb) john allowed my grandparents to (uh) stay on the bus so (ppb) they didn't have to be stressful [lah] like those things that those attractions that they (ppb) (uh) don't want to go but us youngsters we want to go so they are able to (uh) just skip it and rest on the bus <S> yup so that was a (uh) really nice of him to arrange all these for us yup so (uh) maybe you guys can like (uh) compliment him [lah] like just let him know that I've made this comment and like just I would just like to like boost

stayed in (ppb) it was the A_B_C hotel yup cause (uh) it was the first hotel that we stayed in after the flight (ppb) so (uh) I felt that there was very nice view there was a very nice view (uh) from from my room [lah] and yeah there was a bathtub as well so (uh) it really felt yeah it really felt very nice because you know after a long flight you'll want to have like a hotel with (uh) like nice nice facilities [lah] (ppb) so there was a bathtub and ya everything was working well it was very it was it gave me like the (ppb) luxury feeling [lah] so it was a it was a good hotel so you guys can con~ (uh) I recommend to you guys to continue with this hotel especially right after (uh) customers <S> (uh) come down from their flight so it was a good (uh) hotel that make us felt better [lah] after the long flight yup so (uh) another hotel I would like to recommend is the cause everyday we changed hotel so I remember it was the third hotel I'm not sure about the name can you check the name for me <S> which city [ah] (uh) I think it was rome cause third one ya I think is rome (ppb) can you get the hotel name for me that's like make sure that it's the right hotel [lah] <S> [ah] ya ya ya it's the sunrise [one] if I'm not wrong ya I remember is the sunrise [one] ya so that hotel right they actually provided free massage services ya cause actually I didn't know about it because (uh) like my my grandparents were just flipping through the pamphlet then they found out that there was free massage services so maybe you guys can take note (uh) can actually tell your customers [lah] is a good selling point as well <S> ya so (ppb) ya regarding the (uh) massage services right it was just a free thirty minutes service massage servi~ service but (uh) we could add on to like maybe like (uh) for a better experience like maybe add lotion add oil ya I remember there were this few options that we could add on we could actually add on for a longer on massage as well ya so ya it wasn't so hard on the wallet [lah] because they have the free thirty minutes already we just have to add on a bit of amount about a bit (ppb) of money to yeah to get like even like more luxury massage so I thought that was good ya so ya really I totally recommend the hotel and they have their view was so so [lah] like was okay (ppb) (uh) and their breakfast was very nice because I remember (uh) we were quite tired of italy food (ppo) (uh) by even by day chilly and but then they had they had like comforting food like soup and noodles for us so I felt that was good [lah] maybe you guys can like find (ppb) find hotels with (ppo) like noodles and noodle soup and rice [lah] options for for (uh) customers because (uh) you know italy food don't really like don't really (uh) fit our asian (ppb) taste buds ya so maybe some hotels with asian food will be good at at least we (ppb) feel more comfortable [lah] because sometimes even eating instant noodles for like so many days is quite tiring as well yup so we just I would like to recommend these two hotels and yup so just let john know that (uh) I left a good feedback for him and I will definitely leave a good feedback on your facebook page as

coming up to check on it so I basically sat inside the room while waiting for them (uh) for like roughly f~ f~ fifty minutes and after fini~ fifty minutes when they came up (uh) they t~ (uh) the housekeeper didn't even knock the door and I d~ she just enter the room with her access card (uh) w~ w~ (uh) d~ directly so I've I was (uh) quite shocked that (uh) she didn't even (uh) bother to knock the door or to check if there's a r~ i~ is it okay to g~ enter the room (uh) like this so okay so she when she came in I (uh) I actually (uh) told her the I actually just should show her the wash the hot water is not working and after that she will move onto the bedsheet so she started to change the bedsheet while (uh) (uh) calling on to her colleagues to come and fix check on the hot water and (uh) during the the when she is checking (uh) changing the bedsheet the bed (uh) for me right I can her hear her gra~ grumbling at the while doing it than saying that I'm (uh) I'm very picky why am I (uh) (uh) just a small stain (uh) I I'm (uh) making so much of such a big fuss all this thing so I was very angry but I don't want to straight argue with her so I I wa~ I felt that the service is (uh) very bad and (uh) I managed to stay for two days and I don't think I'm going to stay h~ and in your hotel anymore in the future <S> (uh) okay (uh) for the front desk that that that was (uh) serving me (uh) when I try I was trying to check in but they couldn't find I think she was a (uh) ya indian lady (uh) I think in the mid twenties she doesn't look very (uh) knowledgeable and she (uh) she (uh) she was dum~ <UNK> when I (uh) make some enquiries about (uh) uh the fa~ hotel facility like where's the swimming pool all this thing she wasn't able to answer to me but (uh) there wasn't the much of my concern until unle~ u~ until they've (uh) able to locate my booking and (uh) get me to the room after such a long wait so (uh) there's and I didn't manage to get her name so but (uh) she's a indian lady in the twenties yeah then next will be the (uh) housekeeper that I I came across (uh) is a chinese lady in the forties or fifties I'm not sure about her age (uh) her name is (uh) #lim# okay the name is for name just saw the name tag is just #lim# [ah] so I couldn't get the the full name of her so she is having a long hair and she's wearing a a a golden frame spectacle that (uh) that I yeah that's the the and the the technician was okay and then she she they they were managed to (uh) fixed the hot water o~ once they came in so it's just about the the more about the housekeeper that I I I actually felt (uh) the the service is really bad and (uh) the standards of the hotel (uh) really (uh) depreciate and doesn't value for the money once I ask for such experience ya (uh) no I was (uh) very turned off by the service and I can't be (uh) at the moment I I felt it's (uh) I I won't have a (uh) it's not good for me to speak up (uh) and I and the front desk was only that indian lady I didn't see any colleague that (uh) is (uh) I can approach to so I have to make this call after my stay to let to make sure that the management is aware about the the service that I I I I experienced that (uh) I think they need to look into it to make sure that (uh) it's (uh) (uh) make sure the service is good and and (uh) the standard is there because (uh) we are the consumers that we we we pay the money that values to the hotel (ppb) I think (uh) we we supposed to we we sup~ we must get back the the equal equal service (uh) standards that we are expecting or minimumly the the the p~ the privacy and the the basic cleanliness that we we are looking at when we go to a hotel stay so that I think that they (uh) that's why I need to call and give the feedback to make sure that (uh) this is (uh) properly addressed to and I can (uh) there's someone that can give me a answer of why all this have happened and how they going to compensate the for such a bad experience <S> <S> <S> <S> <S> ya I I feel that (uh) training is very important so the hotel front hotels (uh) employees the front liners like a (uh) (uh) (uh) housekeeping front desk they are the first person that (uh) come in contact with customers so if they are not properly trained and they are not (uh) (uh) having the right (uh) mentality for customer service and the whole experience of (uh) from from the start to to the whole (uh) entire stay for the customer will be definitely bad (ppb) so the for the guests is what we are expecting is (uh) to the minimum of the the the bedsheet is clean the room is (uh) as according the booking that we made (uh) there's no no smoking (uh) rooms that don't have the cigarette smell or that at least the hot water all this this (uh) prechecked before allowing the guests to come in so we won't have to have such a problem so I think if if if it all it all boils downs to the quality control and training that (uh) is lacking cause if we are (uh) having a hotel like yours (uh) it's a a four star hotel and with the money we paid and the service we get back is totally doesn't tally with the the the the the stars that you are given so we what we (uh) looking is (uh) on the value of the money cause if (uh) that's the case then what for the we are we paying so much for your hotel if the quality is so bad so I suggest that you have a quality con~ strong quality control and (uh) for more training for your employees in the future to make sure they know how to attend to the guests properly ya (uh) no that's all just I just want to (uh) (uh) share this (uh) to make sure that you get you guys (uh) aware about the the b~ bad experience that I had with your hotel so I hope that in the futures (uh) (uh) this will change or and that you guy guys can compensate me in se~ some way <S> \n",

bedsheet has got like (um) bloodstains and then (um) and then (uh) we did mention it to our tour guide ya but the tour guide was just like pretty nonchalant about it and then <S> ya okay not only the hotel when we go out when we set out for our sightseeing right (um) the package actually actually said that [oh] we will go to (uh) this place and (uh) this place (uh) but actually (uh) over there the tour guide didn't bring us to that (um) exact spot that you guys have mentioned (um) in the package ya he actually brought out (uh) brought us to (uh) I also don't know where [lah] actually ya so and there wasn't anything much to see and then the food that (uh) the tour guide brought us to (ppb) (uh) the food were also pretty hard (um) very hard to chew and then there's no it's not savoury there's no flavour yeah [ah] it's just overall is such a bad experience (ppb) <Z> <Z> [ah] the tour guide (uh) ya the tour guide name was (uh) peter and he's a singaporean (uh) he's I think like (uh)

that's because this guy [oh] professionalism because this (uh) peter tour guide right he he was so unprofessional like (um) (ppo) halfway through like we when we were dining (um) when we were eating at the restaurant then he will just run off to the toilet for a pretty long time and then when we want to find him we couldn't find him (ppo) and then (uh) we will just like as a tour group right we have like what thirty people and all (uh) thirty peo~ (uh) thirty of us we were so lost after dining in we we just wasted our time to like stand there and then (um) just look like lost sheeps and then we don't ha~ and there weren't anything to do like we were afraid that (uh) if we were to stray off like you know we go and walk around like nearby that kind of thing (ppb) then (uh) what if later everybody else goes off and then we're just like left there ya so these are a few concerns (uh) we also had (uh) that we had during our trip also so ya (um) ya [lor] so this tour guide very unprofessional (uh) if you all can you all (um) have like regular checks on (ppb) your tour guides themselves because I believe (um) (uh) for at least for my experience (ppb) (um) the tour guide is the key ya is the main person that we go to for the trips [mah] so I'm not too sure about the location is it the tour guide that directed the bus driver to go to the to a different location compared to (um) the ones that that your proposed or something like that so maybe you all if you can (uh) can you please may be just check it out ya <Z> <Z> <Z> <Z> (uh) no [leh] I think that's all <Z> okay thank you (ppl) \n",

            "<S> (mm) started (mm) okay can okay so (uh) hello (uh) hi I'm calling to give you a feedback (uh) that I experienced at your (um) hotel (ppb) (uh) because I actually had a staycay yesterday and then (uh) me and my friend we actually (uh) ordered this in room massage (uh) service and there's (uh) one of your staff right (uh) I think her name was like (uh) #adilah# ya she was (um) she's actually very nice very pleasant (uh) she actually went out (uh) all the way to help us (um) accommodate the massage session because I'm aware that the massage session actually (ppb) (um) it's the schedule for the masseurs were pretty packed and (uh) because we had our own plans so the timing was a bit difficult to (um) agree upon (uh) initially but (uh) #adilah# actually went out the way to keep on (uh) to keep us updated as to (uh) what are the available slots and (um) to check in on us (uh) whether we can make it for like a specific slots or not and not only your staff #adilah# was (uh) really very (ppb) (um) helpful (uh) the masseurs themselves I think their skills are really very nice and they actually (uh) as they massage us right they do check in on us and then see if it's (uh) too hard or is it to painful or is not like (um) good enough that kind of thing so ya I just wanna (uh) let you know that (uh) this staffs (uh) are really very very very nice <Z> <Z> [oh] so sorry about it (uh) my name is (uh) jermaine <Z> <Z> <Z> <Z> <Z> (uh) (uh) (uh) #adilah# (ppo) okay actually seem (uh) like she's in her mid thirties like (uh) she wears a #tudung# and then after that (um) (ppb) she (uh) yesterday (uh) she was wearing like (uh) this light blue #tudung# and then af~ (uh) she also wears specs and she her height (uh) is maybe around like one six that kind of range one six to one six (um) five (ppb) around there and then (uh) ya and her built right is on more more of the like slimmer side ya I'm not too sure if it helps but this is what I can recall because her name tag only put like #adilah# then (uh) A dot that's it [ah] [ah] <Z> <Z> <Z> <Z> [oh] (um) actually not that much that I can remember but (uh) I really liked your facilities though because they are really clean like (um) I went to the me and my friend we went to the gym and then went to the swimming pool (ppb) and (uh) it's really (um) ya it's very proper and clean like the towels are there (ppb) and then there's also like refreshments (uh) provided (ppb) (uh) but although the refreshment (ppb) (um) we actually went to the gym twice and then the first time that we went which was around like (uh) say if I'm not wrong two P_M (uh) there were plenty of ref~ (uh) refreshments like (um) the (um) bottled water (ppb) there's like also some apples and then some (um) (ppb) (uh) biscuits (uh) for us to help ourselves with but when we went during the night at like (um) ten P_M right (uh) ya it was actually like emptied out and then (uh) we tried to find people to (um) top up the refreshments but there weren't anyone at the gym counter so ya so we were kind of lazy to go out and then find a staff to let them know but ya maybe I think about that (um) ya it's a bit (uh) sad (ppl) that the refreshments weren't there when we went down for the second time (ppb) cause we were kind of hungry after (ppb) working out ya <Z> <Z> (mm) [ah] <Z> [oh] okay (um) so yesterday we actually did went down to the restaurant for our dinner like (uh) the restaurants that you have (uh) at your hotels like this (uh) A B C restaurant and then (um) and then we had like the in room dining for supper (ppl) which is like we were we called in like about what midnight or about one A_M that kind of thing (ppb) so actually comparing (ppl) (um) ya the food experience right the restaurant food was (um) actually so-so like (uh) it's not really very (ppo) (mm) fa~ (ppb) ya the taste is just like [meh] (ppl) but (uh) we already like the in room food though (ppl) so ya because they actually like the it's pretty flavourful and (um) yeah there's like actually a number of variety compared to the restaurant so yeah we actually prefer the in room dining compared to (ppb) the restaurant's food <Z> (ppb) <Z> <Z> <Z> (uh) (uh) (uh) the I think they bake (uh) no sorry not bake they fried their fish and chip like really well (ppl) like the sides were crispy and then the middle of the fish was like really very (um) savoury so (uh) ya and provided (uh) and we had that for our supper which is the in room dining and we were really amazed that like you know we thought like in room dining then after that by the time they serve our dishes right it'll be like cold (ppb) or if not it's like very soggy that kind of thing but surprisingly the fish and chip was (mm) really crispy and good (ppl) so ya <Z> <Z> <Z> <Z> [oh] ya sure (uh) for the masseurs it if I didn't remember wrongly (uh) they were like sally and (uh) samantha ya so both of them (uh) even though their build are pretty small right and they are like (uh) kind of ya their build are pretty small (ppb) so I but surprisingly (uh) when they massage us it was really good like their skills I would say is (um) pretty top notch (ppl) compared to like (uh) other massages that I had when I like you know go to J_B or that kind of thing ya so ya no don't have (ppl) \n",

            "<UNK> now okay if you've started okay (ppb) (uh) ya so over here same thing on my count again [ah] three two one and clap okay cool (ppb) so prompt three domain three in the setting of a holiday making inquiries and perform of change (ppb) so again whenever you're ready feel free to (uh) start <S> hi good afternoon yup yes lotus (uh) travel agency over here jack speaking (uh) how may I a~ assist you again <S> [oh] certainly I think over here we are definitely have some (uh) plans for (ppb) travel overseas [ah] once this whole COVID (uh) restrictions are more little and with more (ppb) lax (uh) so called travel <UNK> (uh) areas (ppb) so (uh) you s~ mentioning that you are travelling to asia by that (uh) is there any specific area that you are planning to go to any cities or anything like that (mm) (ppb) (mm) (ppb) (uh) certainly we do have [lah] and we are actually offering some packages along the way as well (ppb) so for these two countries again (uh) I think maybe to share with you a bit more it's like (uh) before I can do that right (uh) maybe I can get a bit more (uh) head start in terms of your (ppo) objective your purpose of your trip like is it for like work for business or anything because for these two countries right there's also some varying (ppb) (uh) packages [lah] tied into that also ya (mm) (mm) (ppb) (mm) (ppb) okay so I think it's over (uh) around one to two weeks time and (ppb) I think for our promotion [ah] it's tied on more for the (ppb) japan the one to japan to osaka okay (ppb) (uh) ya so over here is (uh) I think over here for our package over here is around (uh) ten days trip and then (err) for your travelling I hear that it's with you and your mum alone (ppb) (uh) just to understand this will be (uh) like a family travel for you or is it like you are with you prefer a guided tour trip (ppb) or things like (uh) is there any like (uh) special arrangements you would like to have for this trip for yourself <Z> <S> <S> <S> <S> <S> (mm) right sure (ppb) so I think to (uh) answer your question over here [ah] miss (ppb) basically for our side we do have certain (ppb) (uh) I think in terms of the outsourcing of certain like (um) (ppo) for some of our so called personnels in the station in the #osaka# area to do some guided trips over here (ppb) but let's say if you are planning to go beyond the #osaka# region to (ppb) maybe somewhere even further [ah] then I (uh) that will have to look into it [eh] before getting back to you [ah] because over here (ppb) it may incur certain additional cost [lah] subject to the distancing transportation and all those (ppb) over here (ppb) that's why I think over here is (ppb) (uh) is there a certain budget while you are looking at and also if there is right (uh) what are the other considerations you'll be like looking at maybe you can share with me a bit more like in terms if you have any (ppb) plans or like something related to insurance along that lines <Z> <S> <S> <S> <S> yes yes I think that's a very (uh) thank thanks for the insights and also sharing [ah] (ppb) so over here is for the plans and all those right (uh) it's something that (uh) (uh) I think first of all is your budget seems to be within our reach based on the promo package (ppb) that we are offering at thousand eighty eight and eight one eight eight eight okay this is the price that we are offering for that two weeks trip (ppb) and I think over here if there's to factoring some additional costs (ppb) that will be a couple more hundreds [lah] if it that that's something that we are I think it can be further work around as to for the documentation wise right yes (ppb) (uh) because of certain (ppo) tightening [ah] for the travel restrictions here and there [lah] we will still need you to bring along your visa and along with your other documentations (ppb) ya your I_C and relevance [lah] I think over it's still (ppb) (uh) again subject you may be subject to certain (ppo) areas [lah] like [oh] (uh) in terms of the (ppo) documentation to bring along [lah] so all these things right I can share with you [lah] to your email account if if you like to (ppb) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) ya so I think for the to answer your question on this is right the I think referring [ah] to the (ppb) one that you called in previously right it's based on the (uh) contents that I think you are sharing that your interest is more for (uh) (ppo) tour package and also in between (uh) you will have your own like (um) (ppo) so-called personalized [lah] shuffle and all those to (ppb) like drive you around for this time [one] right in terms of this (uh) pricing [ah] the one for the one eight eight eight one right it is inclusive of mostly for a free and easy trip (ppb) but (uh) again for the let's say if you are talking about travelling to other cities [lah] or other regions as such [ah] it will be a different pricing all in all [lah] that we will have to further review and look into it (ppb) (mm) (ppb) (mm) (ppb) right because (uh) if let's say you are talking about some other areas right (uh) there's another one which is I will call it as (uh) package C [lah] because I think the first one I will just call it as package A then the one which I shared with you right is package B for the package C one right (ppb) it will be to (uh) japan selected areas for the itinerary for destination is still under review to be confirmed (ppb) (uh) (mm) (ppb) (mm) (mm) (ppb) right sure so for the hot spring request [ah] I think over here it's also (uh) from our itinerary let's say we are following based on our guided tour right there's al~ there's this certain (ppo) (uh) so called two day hot spring trip right that we are factoring [ah] as part of the package also (ppb) so (uh) ya so if that's the case right I would recommend maybe you to take up the package C [lah] over here [lah] but of course I think over here is I do hear that (mm) if if you d~ do have some (ppo) contemplation in choosing like what type of like areas you want to go like between osaka and other cities in the japan area ya is there's any such like (uh) is there any like designated area (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) right right because over here normally it's up to three weeks [ah] in terms of the full refund anything less than that it will be maybe up to a fifty percent or even lower hope this clarifies and is there any final questions that you like to check with me okay that will be all okay cool if not okay thank you and then (ppl) we can just stop and do a submission \n",

may have <S> <Z> (mm) (mm) sure (ppb) no problem I think for the so the facilities or equipment like the beds and all we do have (uh) bed size of different [lah] different sizes be it be you want a smaller one or a bigger [lah] one like queen size bed (ppb) that that can be further arranged no problem (ppb) (uh) just like to understand maybe a bit more [ah] in terms of this (ppb) (uh) trip that you are I think you are you are coming here I mean you are booking this (um) for like maybe you can share with me like how long would that be and maybe like you can share with me a bit more as to (ppb) you are here for like (uh) stay for work for personal for leisure I don't I don't know (ppb) ya things like that ya (mm) (mm) (ppo) <S> <S> <S> <Z> <S> (mm) (mm) all right sure I think to answer your first question first is (uh) as to (ppb) like (uh) in terms of the how how much in terms of the cost and all right it's also subject to your individual budget [lah] if there's any like I think budget constraints or anything you're considering (ppb) because right now it's (uh) I think there's this promo package just to offer to you also (ppb) there there's this (uh) promo package inclusive of (uh) the certain V_V_I_P [lah] so if let's say you are inviting maybe some of your friends to (uh) come and stay over here and there I think that will tied in to (uh) additional thirty percent [lah] in terms of a price package (ppb) so (uh) maybe you can help me (uh) share with me in in terms of like what other (um) (ppo) facilities or amenities you are considering to have [lah] so that I can maybe do a quick cut over for you over here (mm) <S> <S> <S> <S> <S> <S> <S> (mm) (mm) sure I think to answer all these again [ah] for your first question in terms of breakfast breakfast will definitely be (uh) accommodated and included as part of the whole package (ppb) just that over here right (uh) we also offering this extended promo [ah] just I think maybe happening [ah] within that period (ppb) there's this big (uh) there's this really grand deluxe american breakfast that we're opening up to selected guest like yourself right (ppb) that you can enjoy [lah] at a fifty percent additional charge [lah] [hor] so that is something that I will maybe share with you a bit more as to your second enquiry right in terms of the facilities like gym swimming pool we do have all that and it's seems to suggest to me you seem to be someone a bit more of sporty so I'm just wondering (uh) for the (uh) various like outdoor activities and all those right (ppb) (uh) we do have sa~ certain other activities like you can consider exploring o~ over here as well (uh) apart from the pool the gyms and all those right (uh) I don't know because for our gyms we also have this (um) (ppo) I think some personalised trainer like thing that you can opt for also so I'm not too sure like what's your take on this or you prefer like a free and easy session for yourself (mm) (mm) <S> <S> [oh] (uh) for gym right it's open actually for (ppo) I would say from ten to ten [lah] because in between there's some (ppb) maintenance and also some (ppb) equipment check that normally that would be catered [lah] ya along the way but is there like a preferred timing I don't know like in in terms of like your workout and all those things <S> [oh] no no because over here (uh) for our facilities we do provide the necessary equipment and also (uh) I think the standard things like towel showering facilities will be all provided as part of the whole package over here (ppb) ya and I think to (uh) understand a bit more [ah] there's this room request that you are referring to in terms of the view wise right (uh) is there any specific kind of view you are looking to (ppb) (uh) see for your room view over here (mm) <S> <S> <S> (mm) (uh) I think that also subjects [lah] to the the availability over here because let's say if you are looking at the one with the (ppb) (uh) so called marina view and all those right (ppb) it actually comes along with the (ppb) bathtub ya so so would that be a better one for your in terms of your own preference in terms of your request over here or you would prefer something else (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (ppb) ya so over here [ah] thank you for the call in [ah] regarding this so over here is (ppb) for the booking now right we will still recommend you to book online [lah]

hello !hey! and is this the lily hotel (uh) [oh] (uh) I'm #ge jing# <S> (ppb) okay hi actually (uh) I was planning for a (ppb) little staycation so I went online to check (ppb) all the prices and everything just like to know if like booking (ppb) do you have any online bookings that allow us to pay on on in person or must it be all done on credit card online <S> (uh) yes and then I will just ask more about the room as well so that I can decide when I should come down ya <Z> okay (uh) so actually I'm planning to book in december and it's going to be like a three days two nights kind of stay it'll I I'll just need a like a single room but (uh) it would be good if you have like (ppb) double beds (uh) not double beds more like the queen size beds that the a big bed for two but like just one person staying (ppb) ya just want to know do you have any like single room with a queen size bed or or is it must be separate beds ya cause I want a big one for myself (ppl) <Z> <Z> (ppb) [oh] okay okay (ppb) ya ya ya I'm just (uh) I'm just (uh) booking it for my own leisure it's more like a after exams kind of staycation (ppb) so mostly myself maybe I'll have guests so maybe you can let me know later also if I'm allowed to (ppb) have (um) guests in if if I were to book a double room I can at least have like one friend over right (ppb) and (uh) if not then it's all going to be december after my exams three days two night I think I would like it to be in the mid of december (ppb) so I'm not sure if that would be a very (ppb) high traffic kind of time will the prices be like (ppo) hiked up too much cause I mean it's it's near holiday season even though there's (ppb) there's COVID ya (uh) mostly just myself just leisure that's why I chose lily hotel cause you guys are (ppb) right located in the town area in the central so I thought I could (ppb) do some shopping around as well while I'm there (ppb) yes (uh) also but I don't know do you guys have like like maybe a spa zone or like a gym a pool jacuzzi or anything there <Z> <Z> <Z> <Z> [oh] okay okay (uh) definitely a gym I would love there to be a gym and if there's a (ppb) [oh] and breakfast yes if at restaurant if you can offer me (ppb) a free breakfast that'll be amazing I mean not free if if not but like something that is (ppb) affordable or it's part of the package that'll be good then (uh) a a pool (ppb) yes would definitely love to go down by a pool and enjoy with my friends or on my own also so I think that's the three most important for me (ppb) everything else is fine cause I mean we are in the town area I can just (uh) (ppb) grab whatever I need and as for the room (ppb) it'll be good if it can have like a (ppo) a room with windows definitely I want I want like a nicer view yes so I wouldn't want a room with no windows and I wouldn't want (uh) a room that's facing like other rooms (ppb) so city view I would say and just a pool a gym and breakfast I would love breakfast ya so do you guys have that like is there any sort of requirements or any extra charges that I'll need to pay <Z> <Z> (mm) okay [oh] I will definitely love a free and easy one (ppb) ya it just just to go down there I mean cause (uh) if I want to go for a stayca~ right so I guess the gym is more like a (ppb) when I'm feeling it at night when I when I f~ feel (uh) the urge to workout I'll go and do it but if there's a personal trainer I might feel a little more (ppb) stressed out and pressured so I don't want really want to pressurize on my (ppb) own staycation yes are your are your gyms twenty four hours <Z> (ppb) [ah] I see okay (ppb) and usually at night I'll rather be <UNK> at night so after eight or after seven that kind yes so ya if it's not no additional charges for that <Z> <S> [oh] yes okay so online when I was checking I saw that your your hotel was like in the town area in central so I think that's when we can actually directly like face like the marina or something (ppb) like just the the view of the city itself cause I don't know I've been to other hotels where the room the view of the (ppb) the view outside the room is of other rooms so (uh) that's like quite (ppb) I don't know it's just not very nice not to my liking so I would like one that at least just faces the road even if it's the roadside it's fine just at least somewhere out in the city cause I know that your hotel is already (ppb) (uh) located in the central so there's (uh) the the windows facing everywhere else is probably the city view (ppb) so that's what I want (ppb) and ya I just want like a a a big bed a good view and the room doesn't have to be too big so you don't have to don't have to like give me the deluxe (ppb) whatever huge room I just need like the one room with like a big bed and a nice city view yes and also the (ppb) there's the bathroom inside is it like a standing shower or is it like a bathtub <Z> [ah] yes that would that would be nicer ya if I were to book one now [eh] [eh] do you have any available rooms for like mid december and it am I allowed to just book through you now <S> I see okay ya I can just go online now and and jot down the booking then (mm) okay thank you \n",

            "started okay okay can (ppl) okay [oh] (ppb) okay (uh) so hello how do I hi hello (ppb) hi is this the service hotline for <UNK> enough to say the the the name of the restaurant yes [oh] okay I'll just say (uh) (uh) is this the service hotline for Haidilao <S> (uh) yes should be lounge at somerset I went here I came here (uh) last saturday to have a meal and I had a very (ppb) good experience I wanted to call in to give a positive feedback <Z> (uh) you can address me as #ge jing# <S> yes okay so (uh) last week I went down for a meal at your restaurant and I (ppb) it was actually like my first time there (ppb) and the staff was very friendly because we actually didn't make any reservation but we went down and then (ppb) (uh) the lady at the front desk she just straightaway approached me and asked if I needed a table and I ask her if I could get one without reservation and she was like (ppb) sure and then she gave me (uh) she brought me to this waiting area ya and like you guys gave me free (ppb) free condiments and even games to play with and I thought that was very thoughtful (ppb) so I had like a really good time even just waiting before eating my actual food yes and the (ppb) your your staff actually kept coming to me and asking me like if I was okay with waiting for this certain amount of time and they kept updating me (ppb) (uh) the estimated amount of time remaining for the wait so that was actually very (ppb) (uh) I don't know how to say this but that was very welcoming (ppb) yes so I thought I would let you know and (ppb) (uh) I think the waiting time wasn't even that long I waited for around just fif~ fifteen minutes and the whole time I was being served generously with like free drinks and free food so (ppb) after fifteen minutes they brought me in they were very very nice to show me the place and they even asked me if I needed (ppb) (uh) aprons and like (um) (ppo) or a (ppb) a towel or something like that to cover myself because they saw that I was wearing like a dress and they didn't want me to dirty my dress and they thought I would be cold (ppb) so that was very nice of them and then they even (ppb) (uh) asked my friend if she needed a hair tie yes and then (uh) before we even started ordering they gave us like a whole briefing like the staff told introduced herself to us (ppb) at the table (ppb) and told us that I think her name was like (uh) what what was her name again I think something like #jia hui# or something yes okay so #jia hui# (ppb) actually (uh) briefed us everything on the menu cause that was like my first time there (ppb) so (uh) she mentioned to us like what soup were popular and what food should get and she even suggested that we don't order too much because she was scared we were going to over order (ppb) so I think that was very (ppb) nice and thoughtful and surprising because I didn't expect a restaurant to (ppb) suggest their customers to not order so much (ppb) ya cause I thought they will want to earn right but ya ya your restaurant did a good job by like being so friendly to us (ppb) so afterwards she even (uh) helped us to cook some of the food cause ya hotpot and stuff she even helped us to make sure that all our bowls and everything were clean and like serve to us nicely and clean not~ nothing much wrong (ppb) ya she was always around us so it was super amazing our drinks would never go empty cause she will always just keep (uh) (ppb) filling it up for us so ya and then I think throughout the session we still ask her like [oh] what other things she would (ppb) recommend she was super nice to ask us if we were allergic to anything or if you have any preference or how (ppb) how full we're feeling (ppb) [eh] according to the level of like hunger that we still had then she could in like recommend us some (ppb) (uh) either actual food or like just snacks for us to munch on so she actually suggested we get like (ppb) the <mandarin>馒头:man tou</mandarin> yes ya she even she even des~ describe the difference cause there was like the steam one and the fried ones (ppb) and she even gave us like (uh) which one told us which one wo~ would be better for our palate at that time and she even told us that it came with condensed milk so if we like something sweet we can (ppb) go for it yup and our condiments as well she was the one who I think cause of COVID (ppb) so we couldn't actually self-service so she was the one who had to (ppb) like take note of our specific order (ppb) ya cause for my condiments I was quite picky on the paper I decided to mix around like a few different sauces and a few different spices (ppb) so she she even asked me like nicely [ah] how m~ how much of a portion I would like for each one so if I said like a little bit (ppb) or like a spoonful or like half the bowl and she would (ppb) remember everything and then she gave me exactly what I wanted so that was really really nice (ppb) ya and then (um) (ppb) my friend also said that cause that wasn't my friends first time but that was my first time so (ppb) my friend actually told me that was kind of like (um) Haidilao were like their customer service is just like so (ppb) top notch yes so I was very impressed and I thought I'll just (ppb) call in to let you know that that your staff is doing an amazing job and I feel that you guys should continue like you know ya making them (ppb) (mm) just let them know that they're doing a great job and incentivize them accordingly [lah] ya <Z> yes [oh] okay okay I see okay (uh) (uh) she's like lady I think in her (ppb) in her late twenties ya she's quite short so (uh) shorter than me I'm like one six three so I think she's around like one five six or one five seven (ppb) yes yes she (ppb) she's quite slim her hair her hair was black like it wasn't dyed (ppb) ya I think that that's kind of all I can remember and she she's she's really fluent in both chinese and english (ppb) that's also what I remember yes I hope (um) (ppb) the other #jia hui# doesn't resemble her too much but yes ya she should be in the late twenties if I'm not wrong didn't get to converse with her a lot but (ppb) ya just a short girl black hair late twenties at the somerset [one] (mm) <Z> [oh] actually (um) I would say it's the staff that constant check on you I mean it (uh) of course in some restaurants it's very (ppb) (uh) disturbing to have like someone constantly look at you but because it's like a hotpot place so (ppb) sometimes you just don't know what to do with the soup or like you need extra soup you need extra drinks and everything goes in a very fast pace so (ppb) it was very nice of #jia hui# to just keep like (ppb) coming back to us and she doesn't even she doesn't ask us too much cause she don't want to disturb our conversation but she would just look and then she will straightaway know if (ppb) we needed more soup if we needed more (ppb) (uh) condiments if we needed more drinks ya and everything is very automatic so she doesn't even wait for us to instruct her (ppb) she just does it and the food there is also (ppb) amazing because like it it so it so delicious and the portions are like quite generous so (ppb) like often times we don't even need to like ask her for our second rounds or anything so she just kept making sure that we (ppb) enjoyed what we were having currently and she would also ask like if the food was (ppb) to our liking ya cause she knew that it was my first time so she just like (ppb) make sure that I felt very welcome there yes (mm) <Z> okay actually my favourite dish is something that is not very special but it's the chicken (ppb) (uh) I don't know why for some reason I think that's the best hotpot chicken I've ever had it's so (ppb) it's so tender and just so soft and so nice and when it goes into the the spicy soup the #mala# soup (uh) the flavour just soaks all in (ppb) yes there's this one a little hack (um) my friend introduced it to me it's the actually the the fried fish skin (ppb) in your restaurant yes that one coupled with like #mala# soup and flavouring is (ppb) superb so it's like just the right amount of crunch and right amount of softness so I think you can actually like suggest it to your customers if they enjoy like a nice healthy snack ya <Z> (ppb) I would say to just keep doing what you're doing yes and (um) make sure that you incentivize your (ppb) your employees well cause they really deserve it and just keep up the (ppo) the standard of the good work yes and to #jia hui# just tell her that I really thank her (ppb) for ha~ making my time so amazing I don't think she remembers who I am anymore but (ppb) ya just let her know that a customer out there really appreciates what she did (mm) okay (ppl) \n",
